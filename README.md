# Rock-Paper-Scissors-JS

In this project, I have built a more intense version of Rock Paper Scissors game. Rather than selecting just one from Rock, Paper and Scissors - each player will select three moves. Each move will consist of a type (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) as well as a strength value. Each player will have 99 total points to use as strength value between all three of their moves. An example set of moves can be:
- Move 1: Rock - 30 Strength Points
- Move 2: Rock - 60 Strength Points
- Move 3: Paper - 9 Strength Points

The strength for each move must be at least 1.  

After each player's moves are chosen, they will compare moves in the order they were selected. If two moves have different types, then normal rules will apply.
However, if two types are the same, then the move with more strength will win. If both strength values are  equal, then it is a tie.

The player that wins the majority of the three rounds will be the winner of the game.
